The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector,interior gateway (IGP) routing protocol used by routers to exchange routing information.
RIP uses the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from the source to a destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15. This hop limit, however,
also limits the size of networks that RIP can support.RIP version 2 (RIPv2) was developed due to the deficiencies of the original RIP.

- RIPv1 is Classful routing protocol and RIPv2 Classless routing protocol.

- In RIPv1, subnet masks are NOT included in the routing update and In RIPv2 Subnet masks are included in the routing update.

- RIPv2 multicasts the entire routing table to all adjacent routers at the address 224.0.0.9, as opposed to RIPv1 which uses broadcast (255.255.255.255). Unicast addressing is still allowed for special applications.

Distance: (default is 120)
